## Overview

BOOKNOOK is a React-based personal library that allows users to shift books between shelves: currently reading, read, and to read. Users can search for books and add labels to their favorite titles.

## Learning Objectives

This is the final assessment project for Udacity's React Fundamentals course. For the MyReads book tracking app project, a static site was converted to a web application equipped with a search function and capable of recalling bookshelf label changes made to items (in this case, books). Objectives included using React to create an application that allows a user to search and assign books to specific shelves.

## Features

* Move books between shelves
* Search for books
* Bookshelf labels persist after refresh

## Installation

Download project repo. Open the project file. Install npm dependencies in terminal using the command `npm install` and start the development server with `npm start`.

## Built with
